# AI-Fitness-Tracker

We have build a AI based Fitness Tracker using OpenCV and Python. It can detect various body postures like bicep curls, squats and so on. We have used the pose estimation to find the correct points and using these points we'll get the desire angles. This tracker is going to track different fitness activities and render the results to the screen.

First we need to install and import all the necessary libraries such as numpy, mediapipe and opencv. Then starting with capturing video from webcam and setting up mediapipe instance.

Extracting the coordinates and joining them. Then it will find the angle between three defined coordinates.

At last we've applied the logic of curls counting, thereby by diplaying the counts on the screen.

So this is how it works. This AI based Fitness Tracker can guide an individual to maintain a good body posture. 
Thank for having us & providing this platform i.e. Hackathon Dotlash 5.O. We had a wonderful experience making this project and it was very helpful to enchance our skills.
